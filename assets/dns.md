# Domain Name System

**DNS (Domain Name System)** ‚Äî the phonebook of the internet.

## üîç What is DNS?

**DNS** (Domain Name System) is like the **address book** of the internet. It translates **human-friendly domain names** (like `www.google.com`) into **IP addresses** (`142.250.190.4`) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

Without DNS, you‚Äôd have to remember IP addresses for every website you want to visit ‚Äî which is impractical.

## üß† How DNS Works (Step-by-Step)

When you type `www.example.com` in a browser:

### 1. **Check Local Cache**

- Your computer first checks if it already knows the IP address (from previous queries).
- If found, it uses it directly ‚Äî super fast.

### 2. **Query the Recursive DNS Resolver**

- If not in cache, it asks a **recursive resolver** (usually provided by your ISP or Google DNS like `8.8.8.8`).

### 3. **Ask the Root Server**

- The resolver asks a **Root DNS server** (there are 13 logical root servers).
- Root server responds: "I don't know `example.com`, but I know where `.com` servers are."

### 4. **Ask the TLD Server**

- The resolver then queries the **TLD (Top-Level Domain)** server for `.com`.
- TLD server says: "I know where `example.com` lives, ask the authoritative name server."

### 5. **Ask the Authoritative DNS Server**

- The resolver asks the **authoritative server** for `example.com`.
- It returns the IP address.

### 6. **Return the IP**

- The resolver gives the IP address back to your browser.
- Your browser connects to the server and loads the website.

üîÅ The resolver caches the result for a time (defined by TTL) to speed up future requests.

## üß© Key DNS Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **DNS Resolver** | Intermediary between client and DNS servers. Does the heavy lifting. |
| **Root Server** | Knows where all the TLD servers are. First step in resolution. |
| **TLD Server** | Knows where domain-specific (e.g., `.com`, `.org`) authoritative servers are. |
| **Authoritative Server** | Has the final answer (IP address or resource record). |
| **Cache** | Temporary storage to avoid repeating resolution process. |

## üìÑ DNS Record Types (VERY Important)

| Record Type | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Maps domain to **IPv4 address** | `example.com ‚Üí 192.0.2.1` |
| **AAAA** | Maps domain to **IPv6 address** | `example.com ‚Üí ::1` |
| **CNAME** | Canonical name; alias for another domain | `www ‚Üí example.com` |
| **MX** | Mail exchange, email routing | `example.com ‚Üí mail server` |
| **NS** | Name servers for domain | `NS1.exampledns.com` |
| **TXT** | Text data; used in verification (SPF, DKIM) | `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com` |
| **PTR** | Reverse DNS lookup (IP ‚Üí domain) | Used by email servers |
| **SRV** | Service location (used in VoIP, etc.) | `_sip._tcp.example.com` |
| **SOA** | Start of Authority, meta info | TTL, admin email, etc. |

## ‚è±Ô∏è TTL (Time To Live)

- Defines how long a DNS response is cached.
- Lower TTL = frequent updates (but more load).
- Higher TTL = faster lookups (but slower updates).

## üí° Visual Recap

```
[You] (e.g., New York)
 ‚Üì
Recursive Resolver (e.g., Google DNS in NYC)
 ‚Üì
Root Server (nearest Anycast root node, maybe DC or NYC)
 ‚Üì
TLD Server for .com (Verisign's node, maybe nearby)
 ‚Üì
Authoritative Server (e.g., Google's own server)

```

## Summary Table (with Use Cases)

| Record | Purpose | When You Use It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Map to IPv4 | Hosting a website |
| AAAA | Map to IPv6 | IPv6-enabled site |
| CNAME | Alias to domain | Point subdomain to main domain |
| MX | Email delivery | Setting up email (Google, Outlook) |
| NS | Delegation | Who manages your DNS |
| TXT | Email security, site verification | Google/SSL/SPF/DKIM |
| PTR | IP ‚Üí Hostname (reverse) | Spam prevention, server validation |
| SRV | Service discovery | VoIP, chat, LDAP |
| SOA | Zone authority + timing | DNS replication logic |
